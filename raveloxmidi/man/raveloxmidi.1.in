.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR raveloxmidi
provides a RTP MIDI proxy to send MIDI NoteOn, NoteOff, ControlChange and ProgramChange events to a remote MIDI device.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Display current version number and exit.
.TP
.B -c \fIfilename\fP
Name of configuration file to use. If no configuration file is provided, some defaults are assumed. See below for details.
.TP
.B -d
Run in debug mode. This will provide debug-level output to either stdout or the configured log file.
.TP
.B -i
Run in info mode. This will provide info-level output to either stdout or the configured log file.
.TP
.B -N
Do not run as a daemon.
.TP
.B -P \fIpidfile\fP
File to store the pid of the running process.
.br
Default is \fBraveloxmidi.pid \fP in the current directory.
.TP
.B -R
Enable readonly mode. This doesn't write anything to disk.
.TP
.B -h
Display help information including default values for some parameters.
.TP
.B -C
Display the current config to stderr
.SH NOTES
The available options for the configuration file are listed below. Some parameters are marked as multi-value which means you can either specify them as a single value or with numerical index as a suffix.
For example, if there is a parameter called \fBalsa.output_device\fP you can use either:
.LP
alsa.output_device = device_name
.LP
or
.LP
alsa.output_device.0 = first_device
.br
alsa.output_device.1 = second_device
.LP
A multi-value configuration option \fBmust\fP start at index 0 and parsing will stop when there is a break in the sequence. That is, if the values are 0,1,3,4,5 then \fBonly\fP 0 and 1 will be detected.
.LP
The available options are:
.TP
.B network.bind_address

.br
Default is 0.0.0.0 ( meaning all IPv4 interfaces ). IPv6 equivalent is ::
.br
This \fBmust\fP be set in the configuration file for raveloxmidi to run.
.TP
.B network.control.port

.TP
.B network.data.port

.br
Default is 5005.
.TP
.B network.local.port

.br
Default is 5006.
.TP
.B service.ipv4
Indicate whether Avahi service should use IPv4 addresses.
.br
Default is yes.
.TP

Indicate whether Avahi service should use IPv6 addressed.
.br
Default is no.
.TP
.B network.max_connections

.br
Default is 8.
.TP
.B service.name

.br
To connect to a Bonjour-advertised service, use the format:
.br
\fBremote.connect = service\fP
.br
To connect directly to a server/port, use the format:
.br
\fBremote.connect = [address]:port\fP
.br
A port number \fBmust\fP be specified if making a direct connection.
.TP
.B remote.use_control
Indicates whether CK (AppleMIDI Feedback) messages are sent to the a remote connection using the control port.
.br
Default is yes
.TP

.br
Default is 5 seconds.
.TP
.B run_as_daemon
Specifies that raveloxmidi should run in the background.
.br
Default is yes.
.TP
.B

.br
Default is \fBraveloxmidi.pid\fP.
.TP
.B
